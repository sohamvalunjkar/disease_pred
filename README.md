## End to end Machine Learning Project

### Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning project that focuses on training models for various health-related datasets, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.

### Components
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The project contains several Jupyter notebooks for training models on different datasets:
  - `diabetes.ipynb`: Model training for diabetes prediction.
  - `heart.ipynb`: Model training for heart disease prediction.
  - `parkinsons.ipynb`: Model training for Parkinson's disease prediction.

### File Structure
The project has the following directory structure:
```
.
├── dataset/
│   ├── diabetes.csv
│   ├── heart.csv
│   └── parkinsons.csv
├── Sav_Model/
